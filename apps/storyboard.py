                    In the last decade, the speed at which New Yorkâ€™s sea level is rising has increased and is now rising by as much as 1 inch every 7-8 years.1 Around Battery Park, it took the sea level 48 years to rise by 6 inches.1 Scientists forecast that in just the next 14 years, the sea level will have risen by another 6 inches.8

                    Scientists are not certain how fast the ocean will warm and ice will melt. They expect water levels to continue to rise faster, but are not sure just how fast. Therefore scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) have made predictions based on ranges from low to high.

                    Below you can see the range of the NOAA and USACE high and intermediate forecasts for various locations around New York.9 Currently, the USACE high forecast, seen as the darkest red line, is the most likely projection.
